<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The PRIMAP-hist dataset combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of greenhouse gas emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas, covering the years 1750 to 2022, and almost all UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member states as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. For CO2, CH4, and N2O subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), and Agriculture are available. The "country reported data priority" (CR) scenario of the PRIMAP-hist datset prioritizes data that individual countries report to the UNFCCC. For developed countries, AnnexI in terms of the UNFCCC, this is the data submitted anually in the "common reporting format" (CRF). For developing countries, non-AnnexI in terms of the UNFCCC, this is the data available through the UNFCCC DI interface (di.unfccc.int) with additional country submissions read from pdf and where available xls(x) or csv files. For a list of these submissions please see below. For South Korea the 2022 official GHG inventory has not yet been submitted to the UNFCCC but is included in PRIMAP-hist. PRIMAP-hist also includes official data for Taiwan which is not recognized as a party to the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>Gaps in the country reported data are filled using third party data such as CDIAC, EI (fossil CO2), Andrew cement emissions data (cement), FAOSTAT (agriculture), and EDGAR v8.0 (all sectors for CO2, CH4, N2O, except energy CO2), and EDGAR v7.0 (IPPU, f-gases). Lower priority data are harmonized to higher priority data in the gap-filling process.</p>
<p>For the third party priority time series gaps in the third party data are filled from country reported data sources.</p>
<p>Data for earlier years which are not available in the above mentioned sources are sourced from EDGAR-HYDE, CEDS, and RCP (N2O only) historical emissions.</p>
<p>The v2.4 release of PRIMAP-hist reduced the time-lag from 2 to 1 years for the October release. Thus the present version 2.5.1 includes data for 2022. For energy CO2 growth rates from the BP statistical review of world energy are used to extend the country reported (CR) or CDIAC (TP) data to 2022. For CO2 from cement production Andrew cement data are used. For other gases and sectors we use EDGAR 8.0 data. For f-gases we have to rely on numerical methods to estimate emissions for 2022.</p>
<p>Version 2.4.2 of the PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) in the main file. LULUCF data are included in the file with increased number of significant digits and have to be used with care as they are constructed from different sources using different methodologies and are not harmonized.</p>
<p>The PRIMAP-hist v2.5.1 dataset is an updated version of</p>
<p>G&uuml;tschow, J.; Pfl&uuml;ger, M. (2023): The PRIMAP-hist national historical emissions time series v2.5 (1750-2022). zenodo. doi:10.5281/zenodo.10006301</p>
<p>The <a href="#changelog">Changelog</a> indicates the most important changes. You can also check the issue tracker on <a href="https://github.com/JGuetschow/PRIMAP-hist">github.com/JGuetschow/PRIMAP-hist</a> for additional information on issues found after the release of the dataset. Detailed per country information is available from the detailed changelog which is available on the <a href="https://primap.org/primap-hist">primap.org</a> website and on zenodo.</p>
<p><strong>Use of the dataset and full description</strong></p>
<p>Before using the dataset, please read this document and the article describing the methodology, especially the section on uncertainties and the section on limitations of the method and use of the dataset.</p>

<p>Please notify us (mail@johannes-guetschow.de) if you use the dataset so that we can keep track of how it is used and take that into consideration when updating and improving the dataset.</p>
<p>When using this dataset or one of its updates, please cite the DOI of the precise version of the dataset used and also the data description article which this dataset is supplement to (see above). Please consider also citing the relevant original sources when using the PRIMAP-hist dataset. See the full citations in the References section further below.</p>
<p>Since version 2.3 we use the data formats developed for the PRIMAP2 climate policy analysis suite: <a href="https://github.com/pik-primap/primap2">PRIMAP2 on GitHub</a>. The data are published both in the interchange format which consists of a csv file with the data and a yaml file with additional metadata and the native NetCDF based format. For a detailed description of the data format we refer to the <a href="https://primap2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PRIMAP2 documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We have also included files with more than three significant digits. These files are mainly aimed at people doing policy analysis using the country reported data scenario (HISTCR). Using the high precision data they can avoid questions on discrepancies with the reported data. The uncertainties of emissions data do not justify the additional significant digits and they might give a false sense of accuracy, so please use this version of the dataset with extra care.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p>If you encounter possible errors or other things that should be noted, please check our issue tracker at <a href="https://github.com/JGuetschow/PRIMAP-hist">github.com/JGuetschow/PRIMAP-hist</a> and report your findings there. Please use the tag "v2.5.1" in any issue you create regarding this dataset.</p>

<ul>
<li>Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included in the dataset.</li>
<li>Emissions from Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) are not included in the main version of this dataset. They are included in the version without rounding as users need to take extra care when using LULUCF data because changes some of the year-to-year changes in the data come from using different sources or methodology changes within a source rather than changes in actual emissions.</li>
